### How to use these notebooks

1. If you're familiar with Python, Jupyter, Conda, etc. - install locally a working Jupyter environment with OpenPIV-Python
2. If you're just playing around - use Google Colaboratory

### Notebooks

You can find the hands-on notebooks in the [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) folder:
