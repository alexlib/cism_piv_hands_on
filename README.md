### How to use these notebooks

1. If you're familiar with Python, Jupyter, Conda, etc. - install locally a working Jupyter environment with OpenPIV-Python
2. If you're just playing around - use Google Colaboratory

### Notebooks

You can find the hands-on notebooks in the [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) folder:

- [01_intro.ipynb](notebooks/01_intro.ipynb)
- [02_piv_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/02_piv_analysis.ipynb)
- [03_cross_correlation_basics.ipynb](notebooks/03_cross_correlation_basics.ipynb)
- [04_step_by_step_example.ipynb.ipynb](notebooks/04_step_by_step_example.ipynb)

Open them either in GitHub Codespaces, or in your preferred Jupyter environment, or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading the files. If you cannot use Jupyter notebooks on any of these options, it's also easy to run a Streamlit app: https://github.com/OpenPIV/openpiv-streamlit-simple-app
